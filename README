sa
==

**sa** is a sensitivity analysis tools written in C using GSL.

tools
-----

- `./sa-rescale`: awk script for rescaling columns from `[0,1]`
  interval to any other uniform region
- `./sa-sample-random N D`:
- `./sa-sample-sobol N D`: N points from the Sobol' sequence in D
  dimensions (`N` entries)
- `./sa-sample-saltelli N D`: N points from the Saltelli sapling
  in D dimensions (`(N+2)*d` entries); it generates 2 Sobol' sequences,
  A and B, sub-samples them into AB, and concatenates vertically
- `./sa-sample-halton N D`:
- `./sa-sample-niederreiter N D`:
- `./sa-sample-recurrent N D`: NOT IMPLEMENTED
- `./sa-sample-kronecker N D`: NOT IMPLEMENTED

usage
-----

To generate 10 random points in a 4D space using a PRNG seeded with seed 10:

	./sa-sample-random 10 4

To generate 10 points of a 2D Sobol' sequence, and rescale x-axis to `[-1,1]`:

	./sa-sample-sobol 10 2 | ./sa-rescale

Note that `sa-rescale` needs to be edited to include the line in the
`NR==1` block:

	x[1,1] = -1; x[1,2] = 1;

To plot a 2D Hatton sequence of 1000 points:

	./sa-sample-hatton 1000 2 | ./sa-plot > hatton.png

To reproduce Saltelli example from Wikipedia:

	./sa-sample-saltelli 4 3
